This repo is a public fork of [https://github.com/pytorch/workshops](https://github.com/pytorch/workshops), which is an example of how to run a PyTorch model on an Android phone. 
It was edited to use the models [Next-ViT](https://github.com/bytedance/Next-ViT) and [FasterNet](https://github.com/JierunChen/FasterNet) to test the latency of these models when run in an Android environment.
